### Dont Worry!
all your the files modified/added by the script are backuped at the start!

if you want to delete the backuped files run the deletebackups.bash script, after that all backupts will be gone!

### Commands

 1. `git clone https://github.com/renanbrayner/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`
 2. `cd ~/.dotfiles`
 3. `./setup.bash`

*(if you want to setup oh-my-zsh run setupzsh.bash after starting a session)*
